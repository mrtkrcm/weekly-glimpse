#### 3. Architecture Components
The software architecture of Tweek.so can be broken down into the following main components:

##### 3.1 Frontend
- **Web Application:**
  - Likely developed using a modern JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
  - Provides an interactive, single-page application (SPA) experience for managing the weekly calendar and tasks.
  - Features custom UI components to display days, tasks, and collaboration options.
- **Mobile Applications:**
  - Available for iOS and Android.
  - Possibly built using native technologies (e.g., Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) or a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter.
  - Mirrors the web app’s functionality for a consistent user experience across platforms.

##### 3.2 Backend
- **API:**
  - A RESTful API built with Elysia.js that handles requests from both web and mobile frontends
  - Manages core functionalities such as task creation, calendar sharing, and user authentication
  - Leverages Bun's native-speed Web APIs for enhanced performance
- **Database:**
  - Stores user accounts, calendars, tasks, and related metadata.
  - Likely implemented using a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for structured data or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for flexibility.
- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Manages user login, session handling, and access control for shared calendars.
  - Supports permission levels (e.g., edit or read-only access).
- **Integration Services:**
  - **Google Calendar Integration:** Connects to the Google Calendar API using Bun's native HTTP client for event imports
  - **Payment Processing:** Integrates with Braintree's Bun SDK for subscription payments
- **Notification System:**
  - Sends reminders via email (using an email service provider) and push notifications (via services like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification Service).

##### 3.3 Infrastructure
- **Web Servers:**
  - Host the web application and API, potentially using Nginx or Apache for serving static assets and proxying API requests.
- **Database Servers:**
  - Dedicated servers or cloud-hosted instances for data storage and retrieval.
- **Cloud Services:**
  - Likely deployed on a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalability and reliability.
  - May include a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for distributing static assets efficiently.

#### 4. Key Features and Their Architectural Implications
##### 4.1 Weekly Calendar View
- **Implementation:** Custom UI components render a week-based layout with tasks assigned to specific days.
- **Implication:** Requires efficient data retrieval and rendering to ensure smooth performance, especially for users with numerous tasks.

##### 4.2 Collaboration
- **Implementation:** Synchronization mechanisms (e.g., WebSockets or polling) enable real-time or near-real-time updates for shared calendars.
- **Implication:** A permission system manages access control, ensuring users have appropriate edit or view rights.

##### 4.3 Google Calendar Integration
- **Implementation:** Uses the Google Calendar API to import up to 50 events initially, with ongoing synchronization for new events.
- **Implication:** A background service or job handles periodic polling or webhook-based updates to keep data current.

##### 4.4 Reminders
- **Implementation:** Integrates with external services to send email and push notifications based on task deadlines.
- **Implication:** Requires a robust notification system capable of handling asynchronous delivery to users across platforms.

##### 4.5 Premium Features
- **Implementation:** Subscription status determines access to features like additional marker colors or multiple calendars, managed via payment integration.
- **Implication:** Feature toggling and payment processing logic are embedded in the backend, tied to user accounts.

#### 5. Design Patterns and Principles
- **Simplicity:**
  - Reflects Tweek’s minimalistic philosophy with a straightforward architecture that avoids unnecessary complexity.
- **Modularity:**
  - Clear separation between frontend, backend, and external integrations for maintainability.
- **Scalability:**
  - Designed to accommodate growth in users and data, likely leveraging cloud infrastructure for horizontal scaling.

#### 6. Security Considerations
- **Authentication:**
  - Uses standard mechanisms (e.g., email/password, possibly social logins) with JWT or session-based tokens for API security.
- **Data Protection:**
  - Encrypts sensitive data (e.g., user tasks) both at rest and in transit.
- **External Integrations:**
  - Secures connections to Google Calendar and payment
