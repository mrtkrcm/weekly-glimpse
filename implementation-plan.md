# Implementation Plan for Enhancements

This document details the enhancements and refactorings planned to improve query performance, testing coverage, API structure, and DevOps operations.

---

## 1. Fine-Tuning Query Performance and Pagination

- **Audit and Optimize Queries:**
  Review existing database queries for efficiency, ensuring necessary indexes are in place.

- **Implement Pagination:**
  Update query functions (e.g. in task repositories) to support pagination parameters (limit, offset) to efficiently handle large data sets.

- **Performance Testing:**
  Develop benchmarks to measure query performance before and after optimization.

---

## 2. Testing Enhancements

- **Unit Tests:**
  Expand unit test coverage for all critical modules, especially database operations and utility functions.

- **Integration Tests:**
  Increase integration testing for API endpoints and backend services using Vitest.
  Validate that services correctly interact with the database and external dependencies.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  Enhance e2e tests to cover key user flows and API behaviors.
  Incorporate tests for edge cases, failure scenarios, and performance under load.

---

## 3. API Restructuring

- **RESTful Endpoint Refactoring:**
  Review and refactor API endpoints (e.g., in src/routes/api/tasks and others) to strictly adhere to RESTful principles.
  - Clearly separate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Ensure consistent resource naming and versioning.

- **API Documentation:**
  Update inline comments and provide external documentation (e.g., OpenAPI specification) for all endpoints.
  Ensure documentation reflects the refactored design and usage patterns.

---

## 4. Advanced DevOps Enhancements

- **Production Docker Optimizations:**
  Review and optimize Docker configurations for production environment.
  - Implement build optimizations such as multi-stage builds.
  - Include finer resource limits and environment-specific configurations.

- **Integration of Custom Performance Metrics:**
  Integrate performance metrics collection into the stack using Prometheus.
  - Update Prometheus configuration (prometheus.yml) to capture relevant metrics from containers.
  - Monitor container resource usage and application health in production.

- **Deployment & Monitoring:**
  Prepare deployment scripts and CI/CD pipelines that incorporate the updated Docker and metrics configurations, ensuring robustness and scalability.

*Note: These enhancements will be implemented iteratively with thorough testing at each stage to ensure stability and optimal performance.*
